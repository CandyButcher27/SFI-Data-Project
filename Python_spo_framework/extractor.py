extractor.py

This module provides utilities to extract and chunk textual data from PDF files,
specifically designed for SPO and Framework PDFs in the SPO-Framework-Extractor pipeline.

Functions:
- extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path: str) -> List[str]
    Extracts raw text from each page of a PDF and returns a list of page texts.

- chunk_text(text: str, chunk_size: int = 2000, overlap: int = 200) -> List[str]
    Splits a single string into overlapping text chunks of specified size.

- extract_chunks_from_two_pdfs(framework_pdf: str, spo_pdf: str, chunk_size: int = 500, 
                               overlap: int = 200, folder_name: str = None) -> List[Dict]
    Extracts and chunks text from two PDFs (framework and SPO) and returns a list
    of dictionaries containing chunk data, source, page number, chunk index, and folder.
